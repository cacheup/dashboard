# dashboard

This webpage has a dashboard design recreated using this [design file](images/dashboard-project.png).  
CSS Grid is mainly used to build the layout of the page.  
- Nested grids are used for subsections.  
- z-index is used to overlap a grid cell over another.
- Grid properties align and place content in desired spaces. 
- The projects section uses CSS functions to dynamically shrink and expand the cards within.  

Inline SVGs are used for the icons, some of which get highlighted on hover.
